Testing an AI-Generated Website and Its Security Posture

> I asked an LLM (GPT-5) to generate a full front-end + back-end site about pugs, spun it up locally, and then poked at it like a responsible (and curious) pentester.  
> This post documents the experiment: **prompt ‚Üí generated project ‚Üí quick local runbook ‚Üí reconnaissance findings ‚Üí high-level remediation**.  
> **TL;DR:** AI made a surprisingly usable local app, but it also introduced obvious beginner security mistakes you should fix before going public.

## Goals of This Experiment

1. Evaluate how usable a full frontend+backend scaffold generated by an LLM is (spoiler: very usable for local testing).  
2. Treat the app like a black box and attempt basic reconnaissance/footprinting to identify weak spots.  
3. Summarize findings and provide **safe, practical remediation advice** (no exploit recipes).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: I only tested this on my local machine. If you intend to pentest someone else's infrastructure, **get explicit permission first**. Don‚Äôt be that person.

## The Prompt I Fed the AI

> *Generate me a website about pugs. Make it look professional, include services, and make it thorough. Back-end and front-end. Include many features. Don‚Äôt be scared. Generate me the code so I can spin it up locally. Thanks.*

The AI returned a **complete full-stack project**:
- Node/Express backend + React/Vite frontend  
- Sample `db.json`  
- Docker support  
- Admin panel  
- Booking/contact endpoints  
- Simple file upload to `public/uploads/`  
- Tiny file-based DB using `lowdb`

## Project at a Glance

```

pugs-portal/
backend/
package.json
index.js
db.json
.env.example
Dockerfile
public/uploads/
frontend/
package.json
index.html
src/
main.jsx
App.jsx
pages/
components/
styles.css
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
README.md

```

**Key architectural choices:**

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + `lowdb` (file DB) + `multer` for uploads  
- **Auth:** Simple password login endpoint returning a token stored in `db.json`  
- **Frontend:** React + Vite; pages include Home, Services, Book, Gallery, Admin  
- **Dev convenience:** `.env.example` with `ADMIN_PASSWORD=puglover123` (defaults if `.env` is absent)  
- **Images:** Stored under `backend/public/uploads` and served statically  

---

## How I Ran It

I started the backend and frontend locally (no Docker) and then scanned/enumerated using common recon tools:

- `nmap` to find open ports  
- `gobuster` to enumerate directories  
- `nuclei` templates for app/container fingerprints and missing headers  
- `katana` / ZAP / general crawlers for frontend assets  

Below are **important outputs**, truncated for readability.

## Recon & Findings (High Level)

**Major Themes**

- The app is easy to run in dev mode and exposes **dev artefacts** (e.g., package files, dev server behavior). Good for local dev, but risky for production.  
- **Missing security controls** detected by scanners (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).  
- File upload exists ‚Äî ensure server-side validation. Serving `public/uploads` is convenient but needs limits & filtering.

**Concrete Findings**

- Backend listening on **port 4000** (Express).  
- Frontend dev server (Vite) ran on **5173**; crawlers found source files and `package.json`.  
- `/uploads` directory returned a 301 plus uploads route is public.  
- `nuclei` flagged **missing security headers** (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy).  
- Admin auth: single password compared in plaintext against `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (env default `puglover123`). Token saved in `db.json` with no hashing, no rate limiting.  
- `lowdb` JSON file persists data including sessions ‚Äî **not hardened**.  
- Dev server exposes unbuilt source with scanning revealed `src/*` and `node_modules`. Running unbuilt dev servers publicly can leak source and dev endpoints.

## Risk Summary

- **Information Disclosure:** Frontend dev server exposes source files & `package.json`.  
- **Weak Auth:** Single password in ENV, plaintext compare, token stored in `db.json`. No hashing, lockout, or rate limiting.  
- **Insecure Defaults:** Default `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env.example`; `lowdb` stores everything in one JSON file.  
- **Missing HTTP Security Headers:** CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc.  
- **Unsafe File Uploads:** Files land in `public/uploads` and are served directly. Needs validation and safe naming.  
- **Dev Mode Exposure:** Vite dev server and other dev conveniences are discoverable externally.

---

## Closing Thoughts

AI can generate **impressively complete projects** quickly and ideal for prototyping and learning. But convenience comes at a cost: shipping defaults (dev servers, default passwords) is easy if you don‚Äôt harden deliberately.  

No major vulnerabilities were found here, but **never overlook security**. Even a fairly static app can leak sensitive info if defaults are left unchanged.  

Have a good one! üôÇ
